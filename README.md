## My process
Just like I always try to do, I started off with a HTML skeleton. 
This layout is super simple:)
- card-container 
  - card-top
    - QR code img
  - card-bottom
    - h1
    - p

Next, I created a scss file, "watched" it with the Live SASS Compiler extension VSCode and connected the resulting css file to my index.html file.

I created variable, mixin, and card scss files and started working on the layout CSS first. 

Then I added all my style CSS.

Then it was done. Not much to this one but good practice for sure!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass


### What I learned
I got more comfortable setting up SASS in a project. However, I think this project is so simple it doesnt really NEED it, you know? lol. It's basically centering a few divs and rounding some corners. 

Anyway, I learned to remember to link the generated CSS file to the html file or the styles you add will generate.

This was also a great little practice project of building up a quick component. I was quickly able to get this looking like the figma file especially since there is no functionality and didnt even need JS.

UPDATE: I deployed this with github pages which I have not done in a LONG time so it was basically my first time again. lol. I learned how to deploy a lil simple project to github pages.
